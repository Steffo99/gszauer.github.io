This is a very simple binary tree based bin packing algorithm that is initialized
with a fixed width and height and will fit each block into the first node where
it fits and then split that node into 2 parts (down and right) to track the
remaining whitespace.

Best results occur when the input blocks are sorted by height, or even better
when sorted by max(width,height).

Inputs:
------

  w:       width of target rectangle
  h:      height of target rectangle
  blocks: array of any objects that have .w and .h attributes

Outputs:
-------

  marks each block that fits with a .fit attribute pointing to a
  node with .x and .y coordinates

Example:
-------

  var blocks = [
    { w: 100, h: 100 },
    { w: 100, h: 100 },
    { w:  80, h:  80 },
    { w:  80, h:  80 },
    etc
    etc
  ];

  var packer = new Packer(500, 500);
  packer.fit(blocks);

  for(var n = 0 ; n < blocks.length ; n++) {
    var block = blocks[n];
    if (block.fit) {
      Draw(block.fit.x, block.fit.y, block.w, block.h);
    }
  }
